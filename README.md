<h1 align="center">Simple Discord bot</h1>

## Features:

- Main feature: assigning level roles (more like a badges) to members based on activity. For example, if you've been active (active means you are in a voice channel) for e.g. 10 hours in total, the bot will give you a role like this: <br>
  ![Example level role](/assets/images/example_level.png)
- A couple random commands, mainly based around memes:
  - `/ping`
  - `/banish`
  - `/level`
  - `/turtles`
  - `/minecraft`
  - `/leave`
    <br>
    (don't question what some of these do)
- Also has a [dashboard](https://dc-dash.vercel.app/).
